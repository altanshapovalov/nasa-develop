Codes used during my NASA DEVELOP internship. Most, if not all, codes use ArcPy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### extract_by_attribute
Look at a selected raster's attribute table programmatically and extract a certain attribute (in this case, extracting a "habitat" layer to use as a mask in the future).


### extract_by_mask
Programmatically extract by mask (select input raster, select mask, extract, and save output).


### extract_groundtruth_month
From an imported groundtruth dataset (a collection of polygons) extract polygons of a certain month.
